# pogley

An app that handles your warehouse, garage, workshop or any other inventory, so you don't need to keep track of it in your head and you know
what you need to buy and what's already in your stock.

## Project Intentions

The project was intended to tinker around Android Jetpack Compose and see how Google has designed the Android Native declarative paradigm,
compared to other cross-platform ones (React Native, Flutter,...).

## Learnings

- Jetpack Compose
    - Composable Components
    - Navigation in Compose
    - State
- Clean Architecture (Domain, Data and UI layers)
- Hilt Dependency Injection (the differences from Dagger2)
- Kotlin Flows (instead of LiveData)
